# Statistical Performance Indicators

The SPI framework is designed to capture different aspects of national
statistical capacity by employing most relevant and representative
variables that are publicly available. The SPI can be used to gauge
statistical performance of individual countries over time or
cross-country comparisons of performance at a point in time.

The SPI aims to provide an objective, justifiable/verifiable assessment
of the statistical performance of countries over time by using publicly
available information from international agencies and country websites
that were produced by national statistical systems. The SPI framework
helps countries and development partners identify the strengths and
weaknesses of national statistical systems and areas of potential
improvements. It could also provide actionable guidance for national
statistical systems in areas that may require further and deeper
assessment. Key characteristics of the SPI are:

  - Uses only publicly accessible data  
  - Transparent methodology  
  - Easily replicable  
  - Provides a long-time series to track progress in performance  
  - Captures outcomes and supporting elements  
  - Reflects the SDGs.  
  - Facilitates at-a-glance comparisons on a global scale

# Overview
  In November 2014, the “World that Counts” report was published, setting an agenda for mobilizing the data revolution for sustainable development (https://www.undatarevolution.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/A-World-That-Counts.pdf). The report opens with the words: “data are the lifeblood of decision-making and the raw material for accountability. Without high-quality data providing the right information on the right things at the right time; designing, monitoring and evaluating effective policies becomes almost impossible.”

  In July 2015, the centrality of data to the development process was recognized in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development (https://www.un.org/esa/ffd/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/AAAA_Outcome.pdf) which emphasized that high-quality disaggregated data is an essential input for smart and transparent decision-making, including in support of the post-2015 agenda and its means of implementation, and can improve policy-making at all levels.

  The scale of the task was defined by the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals in September 2015 (https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300) which heralded a step change in the requirements placed on national and global statistical and data systems.

  To meet the imperative of the SDGs, the Cape Town Global Action Plan for Sustainable Development Data (https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/hlg/Cape-Town-Global-Action-Plan/) was developed through an open consultation in 2016, informally launched at the first UN World Data Forum in January 2017 and adopted by the United Nations Statistical Commission in March 2017.

  “The Action Plan recognises that quality and timely data are vital for enabling governments, international organisations, civil society, private sector and the general public to make informed decisions and to ensure the accountability of representative bodies. Effective planning, follow-up and review of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development requires the collection, processing, analysis and dissemination of an unprecedented amount of data and statistics at local, national, regional and global levels and by multiple stakeholders. The 2030 Agenda explicitly calls for enhancing capacity building to support national plans to implement the sustainable development goals.

  National statistical systems (NSS) face the urgent need to adapt and develop in order to meet the widening, increasing and evolving needs of data users, including for the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. There is a wide range of statistical capacity among countries, with individual countries setting their own national priorities. Some countries are facing steeper challenges than others. Capacity building is important for all countries, even more so for developing countries, particularly African countries, least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, small island developing States and middle-income countries and other countries in vulnerable situations. This modernization and strengthening effort will require the full, active, and focused commitment of government policy leaders and the international community to implement the sustainable development agenda.”
  This document sets out a proposal for a Statistical Performance Dashboard designed to facilitate a granular approach that will support the following purposes:

    1.	Policy advice for countries about their national statistical systems
    2.	Investment decisions for donors  
    3.	Benchmarking of national statistical systems
    4.	Advocacy for national statistics

  The new Dashboard should help get answers to the following questions:

    1.	What is the current level of performance of the national statistical system? How well does the statistical system meet user needs for relevant and good quality statistics in a timely manner?
    2.	Are some aspects of the national statistical system better than others? Where are the strengths and weaknesses?  
    3.	How does the national statistical system compare with other countries? Which are the most suitable comparators?  
    4.	Where should investment in national statistical systems be directed? What is the likely return on investment for alternative proposals?  
    5.	How effective have previous investments in national statistical systems been? Which interventions work best? Is the national statistical system getting better?

  The requirements of different users of the index are similar even though their perspective may be different. User groups would include:

    1.	National governments
    2.	National statistics offices  
    3.	World Bank staff in Washington and in countries  
    4.	Other international organizations  
    5.	Donors and other development partners  

  The Dashboard builds on and incorporates the previous work done by the World Bank on the Statistical Capacity Index and proposals for a Statistical Performance Index. Since the publication of proposals for the Statistical Performance Index (http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/304431546956224461/pdf/WPS8693.pdf ) many comments have been received from experts inside the World Bank and other interested parties. Some of these comments have also been informed by a discussion paper (attached at Annex A). The comments received have been invaluable in shaping the proposal.

  The COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated the urgency and critical importance of a toolkit for all users to provide answers to these questions. It is hoped that this proposal will provide a timely catalyst for taking the necessary actions at country, regional and global levels.
   
## Further Background

  The upcoming World Development Report (WDR) will focus on data for better lives (https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2021/overview). It will examine the tremendous potential of the changing data landscape to improve the lives of poor people and also consider the backdoors that can harm people.

  There is an opportunity to launch a Statistical Performance Dashboard through the WDR and potential for strong alignment and synergy. The WDR will:

    •	Ask questions about the statistics readiness of countries
    •	Bring out the importance of the demand side in use (and reuse of data)  
    •	Explore the bottlenecks in using data to help poor people in poor countries
    •	Focus on data for improving lives
    •	Recognize that value is not realized because reuse of data is hard  
    •	Consider safeguards: each use/reuse is an opportunity for misuse  
    •	Identify the attributes of a system for data access and reuse
    •	Set out the groundwork that needs to be done and the critical steps

  The World Bank has regularly published a Statistical Capacity Index (SCI) for many years and wishes to refresh it to meet the requirements now being placed on national statistical systems and to support the World Development Report agenda.

  The SCI has been in widespread use since 2004. Recognizing the new challenges for national statistical systems created by the Sustainable Development Goals, the World Bank has reviewed measurement methodologies, proposed desired attributes, and presented theoretical and empirical frameworks for a new, improved Statistical Performance Index (SPI) to monitor progress in the statistical capacity of nations (http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/304431546956224461/pdf/WPS8693.pdf ).

  The SPI framework aims to capture different aspects of national statistical capacity by using relevant and representative variables that are publicly available. The SPI is designed to be used to gauge statistical performance of individual countries over time or make cross-country comparisons of performance at a point in time.

  The SPI framework should help countries and development partners identify the strengths and weaknesses of national statistical systems and areas of potential improvements. It could also provide actionable guidance for national statistical systems in areas that may require further and deeper assessment. Key characteristics of the SPI are:

    •	Uses only publicly accessible data  
    •	Transparent methodology
    •	Easily replicable
    •	Provides a long-time series to track progress in performance  
    •	Captures outcomes and supporting elements
    •	Reflects the SDGs
    •	Facilitates at-a-glance comparisons on a global scale

  The methodology covers four dimensions:

    •	Methodology, standards and classifications  
    •	Censuses and surveys  
    •	Availability of key indicators  
    •	Dissemination practices and openness  

  Whilst this work is seen as a highly positive move in the right direction, the World Bank wishes to expand the scope of the SPI further still to ensure it is consistent with the data agenda of the World Bank and will help countries focus and prioritize on important areas of statistical capacity and data gaps. The proposed Statistical Performance Dashboard aims to deliver on this wish whilst maintaining the characteristics of the SPI.

## Overall Index Scores

Our statistical performance indicators have a three level structure, and our overall score is formed by sequentially aggregating each level.  The overall score is a weighted average of the underlying pillars, dimensions, and indicators.  See more details in the SPI technical paper (https://worldbank.github.io/SPI/).  This tool allows users to change weights assigned to the pillars and dimensions of the SPI.

**The user can change these weights using the scrollbar.**  In order adjust the weights of a pillar or dimension, you can use the corresponding toggle in the bar on the right side of the screen.  In order to produce an overall score for the pillar, we constrain the weights to sum to 1.

# Statistical Performance Index & Indicators


## How to use this tool
The Statistical Performance Indicators (SPI) framework is designed to capture different aspects of national
statistical capacity by employing most relevant and representative
variables that are publicly available. The SPI can be used to gauge
statistical performance of individual countries over time or
cross-country comparisons of performance at a point in time.

This application allows users to explore the Statistical Performance Index and the indicators that populate it.  

The first tab in the application, Global Picture, shows a map of the overall index score, along with aggregate scores for each indicator by World Bank region.

In the second tab, the user can explore details for each country as well by selecting the "Country Reports" tab.

In the final tab, the user can view a table with the overall scores for each country.  Users also have the capability of adjusting weights to put greater emphasis on certain dimensions or pillars.

### Motivation

The primary purpose of the statistical system is to help users of statistics make better decisions or to hold those decision makers accountable. In the words of Principle 1 of the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics, the statistics must “meet the test of practical utility”, serving “the Government, the economy and the public with data about the economic, demographic, social and environmental situation.”
The national statistical system, or NSS, plays a crucial role in modern economies. It provides stakeholders, ranging from policy makers to stock market analysts and the general public, with the latest data on the country’s socio-economic developments. At the international level, monitoring progress on global undertakings such as the recently established Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires high-quality data that must be produced consistently across different national statistical systems. Assessing and improving the capacity of a country’s NSS has long been a part of the global agenda. Since the early 2000s, a few capacity assessment tools have been developed to identify the weaknesses and strengths of national statistical systems by other organizations including PARIS21, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), and the U.S. Census Bureau.   

The World Bank’s Statistical Capacity Index (SCI) is one such tool that has been widely employed. Several international and national agencies have adopted the SCI for measuring progress in statistical capacity building and related investments.   The World Bank mainstreamed the SCI in its monitoring and assessment framework and has adopted it as a baseline indicator in various projects at the country level. The SCI is based on publicly available data, and this has various advantages over other indexes of statistical capacity. A key advantage of the SCI is that it can provide assessment of a country’s statistical capacity in an internationally comparable and cost-effective manner.

Yet, there are several areas in which the existing SCI can be improved. First, it comprises of a limited number of indicators and includes no indicators of some important data sources, such as labor force surveys, establishment surveys, or administrative data. Second, it ignores the data dissemination practices of an NSS, which is one of the key features of data usage. Third, the SCI has been criticized for placing too much weight on statistical output and activities, while neglecting the infrastructure and resource components of statistical systems.  Finally, it is silent on whether the data products produced by the NSS are in high demand.
Since its launch in 2004, the SCI’s methodology and coverage have basically remained the same, while the global data landscape has changed significantly. NSSs have made significant advancements with data collection and dissemination practices. At the same time, the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set an ambitious development agenda for the next 15 years on ending poverty, protecting the planet, and ensuring prosperity for all by 2030. This, in turn, increased the demand for data and raised the bar for national statistical systems regarding their capacity to produce high-quality data. We thus propose to improve the current SCI to better suit the changing global data landscape.

### Overview of the New SPI

The new Statistical Performance Indicators (SPI) builds on the SCI, which the World Bank has regularly published since 2004.  Our new SPI will cover many of the same elements as the SCI, such as statistical methodology, source data, and periodicity, but will also expand into new areas. The goals are to offer a framework that was forward looking, measured less mature statistical systems as well as advanced systems, covered the entire national statistical system, not just the National Statistical Office (NSO), and gives countries incentives to build a modern statistical system.  We also are committing to making our project open data and open code to build confidence in our work.

The new Statistical Performance Indicators (SPI) are designed to monitor how well countries statistical systems are meeting this purpose.  By helping countries and development partners identify the strengths and weaknesses of national statistical systems the SPI can support policy advice for countries about their national statistical systems, investment decisions for donors including the World Bank, benchmarking of national statistical systems, and advocacy for national statistics.  

We identify five key dimensions of a country’s statistical performance. These are data use, data services, data products, data sources, and data infrastructure . These dimensions can be presented in the form of a dashboard that can help countries identify areas for development in their statistical system. Improvements in performance can be represented as a virtuous data cycle that can become self-sustaining.

Statistics have no value unless they are used. The first dimension of the Dashboard is therefore data use. A successful statistical system is one that produces data products that are highly used.

In order to meet those needs, the statistical system needs to develop a range of services that connect users and suppliers and facilitate dialogue between them. The second dimension of the SPI is therefore data services that are trusted by users. A successful statistical system is one with highly valued and well used statistical services.

The dialogue between users and suppliers in turn drives the design of statistical products that are to be created including the quality of product needed for the country requirement. This will incorporate accuracy, timeliness, frequency, comparability and levels of disaggregation. The third dimension of the SPI is therefore data products. A successful statistical system is one that generates high quality statistical indicators that can track progress for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

In order to create the products required, the statistical system needs to make use of a variety of sources from both inside and outside the government. This will include making use of typical data collection methods like censuses and surveys, but also administrative data, geospatial data, and data generated from the private sector and from citizens.  The fourth dimension of the dashboard is therefore data sources.  A successful statistical system is one which draws on all types of data sources relevant to the indicators that are to be produced.

For the cycle to be complete, capability needs continuously to be reviewed to ensure that it is enough to deliver the products, services and ultimately data use required. The fifth dimension of the SPI is therefore data infrastructure. A successful statistical system is one that develops both hard infrastructure (legislation, governance, standards) and soft infrastructure (skills, partnerships) and has the financial resources to deliver.
The 5 dimensions and associated 22 pillars of the SPI are as shown in the Figure below.

A score against each element would facilitate:    

  1. Understanding of the maturity of the national statistical system in relation to others eg quintile groups of countries could be shown against each dimension    
  2. This in turn would highlight relative strengths and weaknesses of the system and give an indication of the extent to which the official statistics could be relied upon   
  3. It would also point to which other countries the country in question could learn from as it seeks to improve and create incentives to develop in a forward looking rather than backward looking way   
  4. Time series would allow assessments to be made of progress of the system and a start point for assessments of return on investment for funding given for capacity building    
  5. A dynamic view encouraging continuous improvement. As countries improve the bar for what good looks like would get higher     


Key characteristics of the SPI are: (i) uses only publicly accessible data; (ii) transparent methodology; (iii) easily replicable; (iv) provides a long-time series to track progress in performance; (v) captures outcomes and supporting elements; (vi) reflects the SDGs; (vii) facilitates at-a-glance comparisons on a global scale.
We are collecting data on indicators for the 22 pillars above. For dissemination, the SPI will be presented both in the dashboard format above and as an index for each country. Further details on the construction of the new SPI are provided in the remainder of the document.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

In this program, I will clean and reshape the raw data files in the
01\_rawdata folder in order to produce the Statistical Performance
Indicators.

Below is an overview of the SPI framework.

\section{Key Discussion Points}\label{key-discussion-points}}

Here are a few concerns that I have at the moment, but this is by no
means an exhaustive list. Overall, there are some indicators with issues
in terms of coverage across countries. There are also differences in the
length of the time series for each indicator. Here is a detailed
breakdown by indicator.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Dimension 1 needs more work adding source documents, NSO social media
  accounts. It also needs work refining scoring methodology. This should
  be discussed as a team.\\
\item
  Dimension 2 has no information for the Advisory/Analytical Services
  dimension.
\item
  Dimension 3 is based on the 15 AKI indicators we defined for the
  original SPI. This needs to be discussed, as John had proposed going
  to NSO sites and collecting SDG indicator information. I abandoned
  this approach, because there is no straightforward way of scraping
  this info. To discuss as a team.\\
\item
  Dimension 4 needs more work and refinement particularly on the
  Private/Citizen generated data section.\\
\item
  Dimension 5 also needs work with having a complete set of data for all
  countries. There are major coverage gaps for all indicators, except
  for the Standards dimension which comes from the SPI team.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{data-use}{%
\section{Data Use}\label{data-use}}

Cleaning for Data Use Indicators. Data Use (5 Indicators):\\
- 1.1\_DUNL - Indicator 1.1: Data use by national legislature\\
- 1.2\_DUNE - Indicator 1.2: Data use by national executive branch\\
- 1.3\_DUCS - Indicator 1.3: Data use by civil society\\
- 1.4\_DUAC - Indicator 1.4: Data use by academia\\
- 1.5\_DUIO - Indicator 1.5: Data use by international organizations

\hypertarget{indicator-1.1-data-use-by-national-legislature}{%
\subsection{Indicator 1.1: Data use by national
legislature}\label{indicator-1.1-data-use-by-national-legislature}}

Based on PARIS21 data use indicator (Chapter 4 of Statistical Capacity
Development Outlook) using national legislature website as source.

\hypertarget{indicator-1.2-data-use-by-national-executive-branch}{%
\subsection{Indicator 1.2: Data use by national executive
branch}\label{indicator-1.2-data-use-by-national-executive-branch}}

Based on PARIS21 data use indicator (Chapter 4 of Statistical Capacity
Development Outlook) using national development plans and poverty
reduction plans as a source.

Our main source for this is the FAOLEX database of legislation and
policy documents maintained by the FAO.

\hypertarget{indicator-1.3-data-use-by-civil-society}{%
\subsection{Indicator 1.3: Data use by civil
society}\label{indicator-1.3-data-use-by-civil-society}}

Based on PARIS21 data use indicator (Chapter 4 of Statistical Capacity
Development Outlook) using main social media platform in use in country
as source.

We are pulling data from Twitter at this point. We have only accessed a
handful of accounts from NSOs, but this could be quickly scaled up.

\hypertarget{indicator-1.4-data-use-by-academia}{%
\subsection{Indicator 1.4: Data use by
academia}\label{indicator-1.4-data-use-by-academia}}

The idea for this indicator is that countries should be producing
statistical products that are utilized, in this case by academia. As a
measure of this, we use the IHSN database on censuses and surveys
conducted by counties and calculate a ranking of countries based on the
total number of downloads of the censuses and surveys produced by that
country on a per capita basis. In other words, we calculate the total
number of downloads of censuses and surveys for a country, divided by
the population of that country, to produce a ranking. Countries with low
scores on this metric, may either be producing censuses and surveys that
are not in high demand or are not producing or adding a sufficient
number of censuses and surveys to IHSN to register highly on this
measure.

The source for this indicator is the IHSN.

\begin{quote}
The mission of the IHSN is to improve the availability, accessibility,
and quality of survey data within developing countries, and to encourage
the analysis and use of this data by national and international
development decision makers, the research community, and other
stakeholders.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
To support this mission, the key objectives of the IHSN are:
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Improved coordination of internationally sponsored survey programs, with
emphasis on timing, sequencing, frequency, and cost-effectiveness
Availability of coordinated and practical technical and methodological
guidelines for all stages of the survey life cycle Availability of a
central survey data catalog which would inform data users of the
availability of survey and census data from multiple sources
Availability of standards, tools, and guidelines that would allow data
producers to document, disseminate, and preserve microdata according to
international standards and best practices Improved collaboration
between data producers and users
\end{quote}

IHSN has a database of more than 7,483 surveys as of August 5, 2020.

\hypertarget{indicator-1.5-data-use-by-international-organizations}{%
\subsection{Indicator 1.5: Data use by international
organizations}\label{indicator-1.5-data-use-by-international-organizations}}

New indicator of level of congruence between UNSD and national database
of SDG indicators. For each of the indicators calculate whether the
number in the database for the most recent year is the same or
different. The indicator is the percentage that are the same.

Note: \textgreater{} I met with significant technical challenges trying
to compile this information. It would be a useful data collection
exercise, but will require significant time and effort. Because this has
not yet taken place, I have not produced indicators for this topic area.

\begin{quote}
An alternative would be to form this indicator using some of the quality
metadata we have collected for the Availability of Key Indicators. This
could include the poverty indicators, child mortality, maternal
mortality, safely managed drinking water, electricity, and debt.

Cleaning for Data Services Indicators. Data Services (4 Indicators):\\
- 2.1\_DSDR - Indicator 2.1: Data releases\\
- 2.2\_DSOA - Indicator 2.2: Online access\\
- 2.3\_DSAS - Indicator 2.3: Advisory/ Analytical Services\\
- 2.4\_DSDS - Indicator 2.4: Data services

\hypertarget{indicator-2.1-data-releases}{%
\subsection{Indicator 2.1: Data
Releases}\label{indicator-2.1-data-releases}}

Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and electronic General Data
Dissemination Standard (e-GDDS) were established by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) for member countries that have or that might seek
access to international capital markets, to guide them in providing
their economic and financial data to the public. Although subscription
is voluntary, the subscribing member needs to be committed to observing
the standard and provide information about its data and data
dissemination practices (metadata). The metadata are posted on the IMF's
SDDS and e-GDDS websites.

1 Point. Subscribing to IMF SDDS+ or SDDS standards 0.5 Points.
Subscribing to IMF e-GDDS standards 0 Points. Otherwise

\hypertarget{indicator-2.2-online-access}{%
\subsection{Indicator 2.2: Online
access}\label{indicator-2.2-online-access}}

This indicator measures the richness and openness of online access.

\hypertarget{source}{%
\subsubsection{Source}\label{source}}

Our source for this indicator is Open Data Watch. From Open Data watch:

\begin{quote}
The Open Data Inventory (ODIN) assesses the coverage and openness of
official statistics to help identify gaps, promote open data policies,
improve access, and encourage dialogue between national statistical
offices (NSOs) and data users. ODIN 2018/19 includes 178 countries,
including most all OECD countries. Two-year comparisons are for all
countries with two years of data between 2015-2017. Scores can be
compared across topics and countries.
\end{quote}

We use the Openness score from ODIN for this measure. The score ranges
from 0-100. It contains scores along five dimensions:\\
- Machine Readability\\
- Non-Proprietary format\\
- Download Options\\
- Metadata Available\\
- Terms of Use

A description for each of these five dimensions is below:

\hypertarget{machine-readability}{%
\paragraph{Machine Readability}\label{machine-readability}}

\begin{quote}
Openness element 1 measures whether data are available in a machine
readable format such as XLS, XLSX, CSV, and JSON. Machine-readable file
formats allow users to easily process data using a computer. When data
are made available in formats that are not machine readable, users
cannot easily access and modify the data, which severely restricts the
scope of the data's use. In many cases PDF versions of datasets within
reports can be useful to users, as the text in conjunction with the
tables gives context and explanation to the figures which helps less
technical users understand the data. Because of this, ODIN assessments
do not penalize countries for making datasets available in PDF or other
non-machine readable formats, unless these formats are the only option
for exporting data. Scores are not penalized for having identical
datasets in both machine readable and non-readable formats. Compression
formats do not affect machine readability scores, only non-proprietary
scores (see next page). Scores are given by data category, not
indicator.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{non-proprietary-format}{%
\paragraph{Non-Proprietary format}\label{non-proprietary-format}}

\begin{quote}
For the elements of data openness, scoring is calculated independent of
the data coverage. If data files are compressed in RAR format (which is
proprietary), data for that indicator should be considered proprietary
even if the enclosing files are in a non-proprietary format. Files
compressed in ZIP format are not affected.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{download-options}{%
\paragraph{Download Options}\label{download-options}}

\begin{quote}
Openness element 3 measures whether data are available with three
different download options: bulk download, API, and user-select options.
A bulk download is defined at the indicator level as: The ability to
download all data recorded in ODIN for a particular indicator (all
years, disaggregations, and subnational data) in one file, or multiple
files that can be downloaded simultaneously. Bulk downloads are a key
component of the Open Definition, which requires data to be ``provided
as a whole . . . and downloadable via the internet.'' User-selectable
download options are defined as: Users must be able to select an
indicator and at least one other dimension to create a download or
table. These dimensions could include time periods, geographic
disaggregations, or other recommended disaggregations. An option to
choose the file export format is not enough. API stands for Application
Programming Interface. Ideally, APIs should be clearly displayed on the
website. ODIN assumes APIs are available for the NSOs entire data
collection used in ODIN, unless clearly stated. ODIN assessors do not
register for use or test API functionality. For more information on
APIs, see this guide. Scores are given by data category, not indicator.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{metadata-available}{%
\paragraph{Metadata Available}\label{metadata-available}}

\begin{quote}
Openness element 4 measures whether metadata are made available. Scores
are given by data category, not indicator. Metadata are defined at the
indicator level as information about how the data are defined/calculated
and collected. ODIN classifies metadata into three categories: (1) Not
Available, (2) Incomplete, and (3) Complete. The following must be
available to classify metadata as complete: • Definition of the
indicator, or definition of key terms used in the indicator description
(as applicable), or how the indicator was calculated. • Publication
(date of upload), compilation date (date on front of report is not
sufficient), or date dataset was last updated. • Name of data source
(what agency collected the data). If the metadata only have one or two
of the above elements, they are scored as incomplete
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{terms-of-use}{%
\paragraph{Terms of Use}\label{terms-of-use}}

\begin{quote}
Openness element 5 measures whether data are available with an open
terms of use. Generally, terms of use (TOU) will apply to an entire
website or data portal (unless otherwise specified). In these cases, all
data found on the same website and/or portal will receive the same
score. If a portal is located on the same domain as the NSO website, the
terms of use on the NSO site will apply. If the data are located on a
portal or website on a different domain, another terms of use will need
to be present. For a policy/ license to be accepted as a terms of use,
it must clearly refer to the data found on the website. Terms of use
that refer to nondata content (such as pictures, logos, etc.) of the
website are not considered. A copyright symbol at the bottom of the page
is not sufficient. A sentence indicating a recommended citation format
is not sufficient. Terms of use are classified the following ways: (1)
Not Available, (2) Restrictive, (3) Semi-Restrictive, and (4) Open. If
the TOU contains one or more restrictive clauses, it receives 0 points
and is classified as ``restrictive.'' Restrictive clauses include:

NSO has a listing of surveys and microdata sets that can provide the
necessary data and reference for follow-up. Upon well-defined request
and procedure per the national law and practice, users and practitioners
can obtain the data collected from the households and businesses when
needed.

NADA is an open source microdata cataloging system, compliant with the
Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) and Dublin Core's RDF metadata
standards. It serves as a portal for researchers to browse, search,
compare, apply for access, and download relevant census or survey
datasets, questionnaires, reports and other information.

the following as a source for raw data produced by national statistical
offices that is used in this modeling.

\url{https://childmortality.org/data}

Data was pulled on April 13, 2020.

source information are available at
\url{https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/maternal-mortality-2000-2017/en/}.
The data was accessed on April 3, 2020. This data was used for modelling
maternal mortality, which are then fed into the modelled estimates on
Maternal Mortality (SH.STA.MMRT) in the WDI.

For our purposes, we will use the raw data from the country surveys as
our data for the availability of key indicators, since the modelled
estimates are produced out of sample, and thus not reflective of a
country's national statistical system.

Countries are ranked by source quality (admin data \textgreater{} survey

\hypertarget{aki-3.7-access-to-electricity-of-population}{%
\subsubsection{AKI 3.7: Access to electricity (\% of
population)}\label{aki-3.7-access-to-electricity-of-population}}

Access to Electricity (\% of population) has 99\% coverage in the WDI
database making it less useful for distinguishing between countries. In
order to improve the usefulness of this indicator, we are making use of
data compiled by World Bank colleagues on surveys containing electricity
items. According to the access to electricity metadata, around 42
countries have no data and an imputed value is assigned based on the
regional average. By going to survey source data, we address this issue
of imputation, which gives a misleading picture of availability for our
purposes. Below is the metadata from the WDI for methods for the access
to electricity indicator.

\begin{quote}
Data for access to electricity are collected among different sources:
mostly data from nationally representative household surveys (including
national censuses) were used. Survey sources include Demographic and
Health Surveys (DHS) and Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS),
Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the World Health Survey (WHS),
other nationally developed and implemented surveys, and various
government agencies (for example, ministries of energy and utilities).
Given the low frequency and the regional distribution of some surveys, a
number of countries have gaps in available data. To develop the
historical evolution and starting point of electrification rates, a
simple modeling approach was adopted to fill in the missing data points
- around 1990, around 2000, and around 2010. Therefore, a country can
have a continuum of zero to three data points. There are 42 countries
with zero data point and the weighted regional average was used as an
estimate for electrification in each of the data periods. 170 countries
have between one and three data points and missing data are estimated by
using a model with region, country, and time variables. The model keeps
the original observation if data is available for any of the time
periods. This modeling approach allowed the estimation of
electrification rates for 212 countries over these three time periods
(Indicated as ``Estimate''). Notation ``Assumption'' refers to the
assumption of universal access in countries classified as developed by
the United Nations. Data begins from the year in which the first survey
data is available for each country.

Quarterly GDP numbers were pulled from the IMF website.

After GDP by expenditure, quarterly GDP is probably the most important
development to be made in a system of National Accounts, before the
development of full sectoral accounts. IMF IFS has quarterly GDP from
various sources, including governments and international agencies at

goods, services and primary
income)}\label{aki-3.15-debt-service-ppg-and-imf-only-of-exports-of-goods-services-and-primary-income}}

For this indicator, Debt service (PPG and IMF only, \% of exports of
goods, services and primary income), we will pull data from the WDI but
modify the scoring using the WDI metadata on whether the external debt
data is actual, estimated, or preliminary. The status ``as reported
(actual)'' indicates that the country was fully current in its reporting
under the DRS and that World Bank staff are satisfied that the reported
data give an adequate and fair representation of the country's total
public debt. ``Preliminary'' data are based on reported or collected
information, but because of incompleteness or other reasons, an element
of staff estimation is included. ``Estimated'' data indicate that
countries are not current in their reporting and that a significant
element of staff estimation has been necessary for producing the data
tables.

Scoring is as follows:

Frequency:

0.5 Point. 3 or more values available within past 5 years\\
0.3 Points. 2 values available within past 5 years;\\
0.15 Points. 1 values available within past 5 years;\\
0 Points. None within past 5 years

Quality:

0.5 Points. Actual value 0.3 Points. Preliminary value 0.15 Points.
Estimated value 0 Points. No value

\end{itemize}

Civil registration is the act of recording and documenting of vital
events in a person's life (including birth, marriage, divorce, adoption,
and death and cause of death) and is a fundamental function of national
governments. Birth registration establishes an individual's legal
identity at birth. A legal identity, name, nationality, and proof of
age, are important human rights. They enable individuals to be included
in various government, social and private services, and include the
right to vote, etc. Vital statistics are compiled using civil
registration information on these vital events. The availability of
reliable and up-to-date vital statistics depends on the level of
development of civil registration programs. An effective civil
registration and vital statistics (CRVS) system is critical for planning
and monitoring programs across several sectors.

By complete, that is representing 90 per cent or more of the events
occurring in the specified year.

\subsubsection{Source}\label{source-1}}

Our source for this indicator is Open Data Watch. From Open Data watch:

\begin{quote}
The Open Data Inventory (ODIN) assesses the coverage and openness of
official statistics to help identify gaps, promote open data policies,
improve access, and encourage dialogue between national statistical
offices (NSOs) and data users. ODIN 2018/19 includes 178 countries,
including most all OECD countries. Two-year comparisons are for all
countries with two years of data between 2015-2017. Scores can be
compared across topics and countries.
\end{quote}

We use their indicator on whether indicators are available at the first
or second administrative level. To identify the first administrative
levels, ODIN largely draws on the ISO 3166-2 standard. In many
countries, first administrative levels refer to governorates, regions,
or province. No official list exists for the second administrative level
classifications. If geographical disaggregation exists that does not
qualify as first administrative level, assume that the data are
disaggregated to the second administrative level as long as the
classification appears to be a further divisions of the first
administrative level.

Scoring for the ODIN indicators for geospatial information is below:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  1 point if all published data in a data category are available at
  first/second administrative level.\\
\item
  0.5 points if some published data in a data category are available at
  first/second administrative level.\\
\item
  0 points if no data are available at this level
\end{itemize}

There are 21 data categories.

1. Population and Vital Statistics\\
2. Education Facilities\\
3. Education Outcomes\\
4. Health Facilities\\
5. Health Outcomes\\
6. Reproductive Health\\

16. Balance of Payments

Environmental Statistics\\
17. Land Use\\
18. Resource Use\\
19. Energy Use\\
20. Pollution\\
21. Built Environment

For the first administrative unit: Money \& Banking, International
Trade, and Balance of Payments are not scored for this element. For
various indicators, lenient interpretations are used for first
administrative divisions.

For the second administrative unit: Money \& Banking, International
Trade, Balance of Payments, National Accounts, Government Finance
,Pollution, Energy Use, Price Indexes, and Resource Use are not scored
for this element. For various indicators within categories, second
administrative level data is not required as well.

In the scores we present below, we show a score between 0 and 1 with a
maximum score of 1, which would mean the country has geo data in full
for 100\% of elements. A score of 0 indicates no data at all for any
elements.

Consumer Price Index serves as indicators of inflation and reflects
changes in the cost of acquiring a fixed basket of goods and services by
the average consumer.\\
Weights are usually derived from consumer expenditure surveys and the
CPI base year refers to the year the weights were derived. It is
recommended that the base year be changed periodically to reflect
changes in expenditure structure.

\hypertarget{classification-of-household-consumption}{%
\subsubsection{5.2.5 Classification of household
consumption}\label{classification-of-household-consumption}}

Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP)
is used in household budget surveys, consumer price indices and
international comparisons of gross domestic product (GDP) and its
component expenditures.\\
Although COICOP is not strictly linked to any particular model of
consumer behavior, the classification is designed to broadly reflect
differences in income elasticities. It is an integral part of the
SNA1993 and more detailed subdivision of the classes provide
comparability between countries and between statistics in these
different areas.

(COICOP) 0 Points. Otherwise

\hypertarget{classification-of-status-of-employment}{%
\subsubsection{5.2.6 Classification of status of
employment}\label{classification-of-status-of-employment}}

Classification of status of employment refers to employment data that
are compiled using the current international standard International
Classification of Status in Employment (ISCE-93). It classifies jobs
with respect to the type of explicit or implicit contract of employment
between the job holder and the economic unit in which he or she is
employed. Therefore, it aims to provide the basis for production of
internationally comparable statistics on the employment relationship,
including the distinction between salaried employment and
self-employment.
